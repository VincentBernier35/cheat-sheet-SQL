# 1. Finding Data Queries

### **SELECT**
* `SELECT * FROM dbname`

### **DISTINCT**: filters away duplicate values and return rows of specified column
* `SELECT DISTINCT * FROM table_name`

### **WHERE**: USED TO FILTER
* `SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
* `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND condition2;`
* `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition1 OR condition2;`
* `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE NOT condition;`
* `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND (condition2 OR condition3);`
* `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE EXISTS (select column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);`

### **ORDER BY**: sort the result ascending or descending
* `SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column;`
* `SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column DESC;`
* `SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 asc, column2 DESC;`

### **SELECT TOP**: used to specify the number of records to return from top of table
* `SELECT TOP number colums_name FROM from table_name WHERE condition;`
* `SELECT TOP percent colums_name FROM from table_name WHERE condition;`
  * Not all database systems support `SELECT TOP`. The Mysql equivalent is the `limit` clause
* `SELECT column_names FROM table_name LIMIT offset, count;`

### **LIKE**: operator used in a WHERE clause to search for a specific pattern in a column
* % (percent sign) is a wildcard character that represents zero, one or multiple 
* _ (underscore) is a wild card charactertahat represents a single character
* `SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;`
* `LIKE 'a%'` (find any values that start with 'a')
* `LIKE '%a'` (find any values that end with 'a')
* `LIKE '%or%'` (find any values that have 'or' in any position)
* `LIKE '_r'` (find any values that have _r in the second position)
* `LIKE 'a_%_%'` (find any values that start with 'a' and are at least 3 characters in length)
* `LIKE '[a_c]%'` (find any values starting with 'a', 'b' or 'c')

### **IN** operator that allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause 
* essentially the IN operator is shorthand for multiple OR conditions
* `SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);`
* `SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (SELECT STATEMENT);`

### **BETWEEN**: operator who select values within a given range 
* `SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;`
* `SELECT * FROM products WHERE (column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2) AND NOT #01/01/2022# AND #02/06/2022#;`
* `SELECT * FROM products WHERE column_name BETWEEN #01/01/2022# AND #02/06/2022#;`

### **NULL**: values in a field with no value
* `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;`
* `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;`

### **AS**: aliases are used to assign a temporary name to a table or column
* `SELECT column_name AS alias_name FROM table_name;`
* `SELECT column_name FROM table AS alias_name;`
* `SELECT column_name AS alias_name1, column_name2_AS alias_name2;`
* `SELECT column_name1, column_name2 + ',' + column_name3 AS alias_name2;`

### **UNION**: set operator used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements
* Each SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of colums
* The colums must have similar Datatypes
* the  columns in each  SELECT statement must also be in the same order
* `SELECT colums_names FROM table1 UNION SELECT column_name FROM table2;`
* `union` operator only selects distinct values, `UNION ALL` will allow duplicates

### **INTERSECT**: set operator which is used to return the records that two SELECT statements have in common
* Generally used the same way as **UNION** above
* `SELECT columns_name FROM table1 INTERSECT SELECT column_name FROM table2;`

### **EXCEPT**: set operator used to return all the records in the first SELECT statement that are not found in the second SELECT statement
* Generally used the same way as **UNION** above
* `SELECT columns_name FROM table1 EXCEPT SELECT column_name FROM table2;`

### **ANY|ALL**: operator used to check subquery conditions used within a WHERE or HAVING clauses
* The `ANY` operator returns true if any subquery values meet the condition
* The `ALL` operator returns true if all subquery values meet the condition
* `SELECT columns_name FROM table1 WHERE column_name operator (ANY|ALL) (SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);`

### **GROUP BY**: statement often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result-set by one or more columns
* `SELECT column_name1, COUNT(column_name2) FROM table_name WHERE condition GROUP BY column_name1 ORDER BY COUNT(column_name2) DESC;`

### **HAVING**: this clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions
* `SELECT COUNT(column_name1), column_name2 FROM table GROUP BY column_name2 HAVING COUNT(column_name1) > 5`;

### **WITH**: often used for retrieving hierarchical data or re-using temp result set several times in a query. Also referred to as "Common Table Expression"
* `WITH RECURSIVE cte AS (`
* `&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT c0.* FROM categories AS c0 WHERE id = 1 # Starting point`
* `&nbsp;&nbsp;UNION ALL`
* `&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT c1.* FROM categories AS c1 JOIN cte ON c1.parent_category_id = cte.`
* `id`
* `)`
* `SELECT *`
* `FROM cte`

# 2. Data Modification Queries

### **INSERT INTO**: used to insert new records/rows in a table
* `INSERT INTO` table_name (column1, column2) `VALUES` (value1, value2);
* `INSERT INTO` table_name `VALUES` (value1, value2 â€¦);

### **UPDATE**: used to modify the existing records in a table
* `UPDATE` table_name `SET` column1 = value1, column2 = value2 `WHERE` condition;
* `UPDATE` table_name `SET` column_name = value;

### **DELETE**: used to delete existing records/rows in a table
* `DELETE FROM` table_name `WHERE` condition;
* `DELETE` * `FROM` table_name;

<a name="report"></a>
# 3. Reporting Queries

### **COUNT**: returns the # of occurrences
* `SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT` column_name`)`;

### **MIN() and MAX()**: returns the smallest/largest value of the selected column
* `SELECT MIN (`column_names`) FROM` table_name `WHERE` condition;
* `SELECT MAX (`column_names`) FROM` table_name `WHERE` condition;

### **AVG()**: returns the average value of a numeric column
* `SELECT AVG (`column_name`) FROM` table_name `WHERE` condition;

### **SUM()**: returns the total sum of a numeric column
* `SELECT SUM (`column_name`) FROM` table_name `WHERE` condition;

<a name="joins"></a>
# 4. Join Queries

###  **INNER JOIN**: returns records that have matching value in both tables
* `SELECT` column_names `FROM` table1 `INNER JOIN` table2 `ON` table1.column_name=table2.column_name;
* `SELECT` table1.column_name1, table2.column_name2, table3.column_name3 `FROM` ((table1 `INNER JOIN` table2 `ON` relationship) `INNER JOIN` table3 `ON` relationship);

### **LEFT (OUTER) JOIN**: returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matched records from the right table (table2)
* `SELECT` column_names `FROM` table1 `LEFT JOIN` table2 `ON` table1.column_name=table2.column_name;

### **RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN**: returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matched records from the left table (table1)
* `SELECT` column_names `FROM` table1 `RIGHT JOIN` table2 `ON` table1.column_name=table2.column_name;

### **FULL (OUTER) JOIN**: returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
* `SELECT` column_names `FROM` table1 ``FULL OUTER JOIN`` table2 `ON` table1.column_name=table2.column_name;

### **Self JOIN**: a regular join, but the table is joined with itself
* `SELECT` column_names `FROM` table1 T1, table1 T2 `WHERE` condition;

<a name="view"></a>
# 5. View Queries

### **CREATE**: create a view
* `CREATE VIEW` view_name `AS SELECT` column1, column2 `FROM` table_name `WHERE` condition;

### **SELECT**: retrieve a view
* `SELECT` * `FROM` view_name;

### **DROP**: drop a view
* `DROP VIEW` view_name;

<a name="alter"></a>
# 6. Altering Table Queries

### **ADD**: add a column
* `ALTER TABLE` table_name `ADD` column_name column_definition;

### **MODIFY**: change data type of column
* `ALTER TABLE` table_name `MODIFY` column_name column_type;

### **DROP**: delete a column
* `ALTER TABLE` table_name `DROP COLUMN` column_name;

<a name="create"></a>
# 7. Creating Table Query

### **CREATE**: create a table
* `CREATE TABLE` table_name `(` <br />
   `column1` `datatype`, <br />
   `column2` `datatype`, <br />
   `column3` `datatype`, <br />
   `column4` `datatype`, <br />
   `);`
